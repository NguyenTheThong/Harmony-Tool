# Harmony-Tool
This is a tool help you to find chords and notes of each scale. It also give you what chords contain a specific note. I write this tool for myself. I need a fast tool insteads of finding in the internet. I am a newbie a OOP, so that my code is a little messy.

Note: I am not good at music theory, so this tool just contains major, minor chords and scales.
