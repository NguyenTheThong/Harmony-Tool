# Harmony-Tool
This is a tool help you to find chords and notes of each scale. It also give you what chords contain a specific note. I write this tool for myself. I need a fast tool insteads of finding in the internet. I am a newbie a OOP, so that my code is a little messy.

Features:
- Show notes in the selected scale
- Show notes in the parallel scale
- Find main chords in scale
- Find note with interval, and what chords contain specific note.
- (Future) Find scale which contain a list of input notes
- (Future) Add more kind of chord: augmented, diminished, dominant, ...

Note: I am not good at music theory, so now, this tool just contains major, minor chords and scales.
